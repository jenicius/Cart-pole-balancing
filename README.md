# Cart pole balancing
An assignment from CS229 - Machine Learning course from Stanford University (2019).

The cart-pole balancing problem is a classic control task where the goal is to keep a pole balanced by moving a cart left or right.  
The objective of this assignment is to train a model that solve the cart-pole balancing problem.  
I tackled the problem with Markov Decision Process by simulating the situation based on Physics to model the cart-pole system based on its speed and direction.
The state space is discretized to learn the approriate move (left/right) in each state.  

After approximately 200 iterations, the system succeeded to balance itself independent of its starting state.
